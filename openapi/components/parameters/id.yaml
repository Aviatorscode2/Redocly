  **City ID**. *Example: `2172797`*. You can call by city ID. The API responds
  with the exact result. The List of city IDs can be downloaded
  [here](http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/). You can include multiple
  cities in this parameter &mdash; just separate them by commas. The limit of
  locations is 20. *Note: A single ID counts as a one API call. So, if you have
  city IDs, it's treated as 3 API calls.*
